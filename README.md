## Project Development Notes:
The Taste of Taco Tuesday was created with React, React Router, Redux, Redux Thunks, SCSS and Material UI. The application focused on practicing use of data fetched from an external API. Tests were written using Jest and Enzyme. 

## Future Development and Extensions Notes:
In the future, I would like to implement favorite functionality to save taco recipes for future exploration in the kitchen.
